Underdark notes
PARTIALLY WORKING:
- limit total hitpoints at start (limited from 2nd turn onwards)


TO-DO:
- encumbrance display
- food & drink
- XP charts ( ActorLevel.exp_chart = function(level) return 1000*level*(level+1)/2 end )
- feat select screen
- Favored Classes'work by being +10% exp to that class
- level up screen
- factions

LATER:

- crits
- skills  +5, +10, +15, +20 [handle them with talents and maybe loops]
- calendar
- stores
- achievements

SOME TIME IN THE FUTURE:
- ranged combat
- hide/move silently
- sneak attack
- flanking
- flat-footed (foes in range?)
- metamagic as sustains...and just assume every 'mage' is a sorcerer; have the Empower Spell sustain, you turn it on, cast a spell,
it treats all variable as *1.5 but calculates cost as if it was 2 higher. Just for ease of use I'd suggest turning the sustain off after that
- Cleave (as in - if you kill something and have Cleave and it's the first time it happened, don't use energy)
- reserve feats http://dndtools.eu/feats/categories/reserve/
- PrCs / BG2 style kits


- randomized item names
- level feelings
- eating corpses
- bones

DIFFICULT:
- stairs having a chance of not changing the depth
- remove staircases from which you arrived
