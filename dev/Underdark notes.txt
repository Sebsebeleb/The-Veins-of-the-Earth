LATER:
- ranged combat
- myconids
- stores
- achievements

SOME TIME IN THE FUTURE:
- hide/move silently
- sneak attack
- flanking
- flat-footed (foes in range?)
- Cleave (as in - if you kill something and have Cleave and it's the first time it happened, don't use energy)
- reserve feats http://dndtools.eu/feats/categories/reserve/
- PrCs / BG2 style kits    [Vermin Lord]
- faerzress gives mutations


- randomized item names
- level feelings
- eating corpses
- bones

DIFFICULT:

- remove staircases from which you arrived
